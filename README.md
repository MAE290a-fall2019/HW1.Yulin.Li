# HW1.Yulin.Li
homework 1 for Yulin Li, PID  A53310740

Home work Details:
Leveraging the tensegrity_statics and tensegrity_plot codes provided from my GitHub page, following the examples provided, write a new test code, MitchelTruss4.m, for a Michell Truss of order 4, given as Figure 4.6 In the pdf of Bob’s book (note that the nodal points on the circle at the left are taken as fixed nodes P_i, whereas all other nodal points are taken as free nodes Q_i). 

Also, write a new test code, NonminimalPrism4.m, for a non minimal tensegrity prism with 4 bars as shown in Figure 3.43 of Bob’s book, but with 4 bars (all nodal points are taken as free nodes Q_i in this design).

Discuss both tensegirty structures in your HW1report, specifically including the following for each:
A) Is this structure potentially inconsistent?  What does that mean?
B) is this structure undetermined?  What does that mean?  If it is underdetermined, is it pretensionable, or only tensionable under load?  Discuss.
Also include any other salient points regarding these designs.  You are encouraged to explore well beyond the specific questions asked; extra credit will be granted as appropriate...
